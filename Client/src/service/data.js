As a coach who also consults on nutrition, I was impressed by how the app adjusted macros based on sleep, training, and recovery — it’s like having a coach and educator in your pocket. RP didn’t just help me get lean — it helped me level up as an athlete and a professional.",

I love that the app truly acts as a personalized diet coach - from the macros, to the reminders, to the check-ins. It's a tool that eliminates the guesswork, and easily allows me to prioritize my health in a very chaotic season of life. I can't recommend the RP Diet App enough!",
